# Todo List String Sum 

1. Handle the case where both inputs are valid natural numbers as strings
2. Handle cases where one or both inputs are empty strings (should treat as "0")
3. Handle cases where one or both inputs are invalid (non-natural numbers like "abc", "-5", etc.)
4. Ensure the sum result is always returned as a string
5. Refactor code if necessary
